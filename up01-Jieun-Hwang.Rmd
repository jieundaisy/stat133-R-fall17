### tips
> This recipe is for students who don't have enough time to cook during semester. 
Personally, I usually save a lot of pasta and heat it up. 
> _**It is very convenient and pasta is delicious!**_
> You can put creamy white sauce instead of tomato sauce depending of your taste

# Quadratic Equation

##_**quadratic equation**_ : \[ax^2+bx+c = 0\]

> where x represents an unknown, and a, b, and c represent known numbers such that a is > not equal to 0. If a = 0, then the equation is linear, not quadratic. 
>
The numbers a, b, and c are the coefficients of the equation, and may be distinguished by calling  them, respectively, the quadratic coefficient, the linear coefficient and the constant or free term
 
##_**the quadratic formula for the roots of the general quadratic equation**_
\[x= \frac{-b Â± \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\]
