### tips

> This recipe is for students who don't have enough time to cook during semester. Personally, I usually save a lot of pasta and heat it up. ***It is very convenient and pasta is delicious!*** You can put creamy white sauce instead of tomato sauce depending of your taste or check other recipe [pasta\_Recipe](http://www.seriouseats.com/2017/03/quick-pasta-recipes.html)

Quadratic Equation
==================

***quadratic equation*** : 
*a**x*<sup>2</sup> + *b**x* + *c* = 0
-------------------------------------

> where x represents an unknown, and a, b, and c represent known numbers such that a is &gt; not equal to 0. If a = 0, then the equation is linear, not quadratic.
>
> The numbers a, b, and c are the coefficients of the equation, and may be distinguished by calling them, respectively, the quadratic coefficient, the linear coefficient and the constant or free term

***the quadratic formula for the roots of the general quadratic equation***
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

$$x= \\frac{-b ± \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$
