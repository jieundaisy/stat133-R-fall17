- Brief description : In this assignment I will focus on a hypothetical question: If I had to come up with a        ranking system for the teams, how would I rank them?. I am going to consider differentcways to rank the NBA teams. From simple rankings based on a given observed variable, to rankings based on derived indices like e ciency (i.e. EFF), to rankings based on a composite index using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
